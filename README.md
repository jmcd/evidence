Evidence
========

Evidence is a simple app focused on providing the user with assurance that they have performed an important task, where they do not trust their own recolection. 

Use cases include: 

* You want to be assured that you have taken your pills; 
* You want to be assured that your door is locked correctly; 
* You want to be assured that you turned the cooker off before going to bed. 

The user takes a video or photo of themselves performing the task. The evidence is saved to the device, with a task description and time-stamp. A notification is sent later, reinforcing the evidence.
